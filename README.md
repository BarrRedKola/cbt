#Fork of NFPA
Cloud Benchmarking Tool (CBT)
=======
Original project can be found here: 
[https://github.com/cslev/nfpa](https://github.com/cslev/nfpa)

[http://nfpa.tmit.bme.hu](http://nfpa.tmit.bme.hu)


As NFPA is open-source, we found it better to fork the project and implement our own needs than
notifying the original developer and press him with them.

The aims of CBT is to extend existing features and add completely new ones.
Hopefully, the original author shall find these modifications useful and as production-ready as he would have implemented it,
this way a merge at the end may happen :)
